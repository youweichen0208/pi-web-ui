/**
 * Streaming markdown segmentation — the core of the prefix-cache renderer.
 *
 * Problem: during streaming, the accumulated text changes on EVERY delta, so a
 * memoized full-document <Markdown text={...}> re-parses (remark → rehype →
 * highlight.js) the whole growing string per frame — O(n²) cumulative work
 * that visibly janks long code-heavy replies.
 *
 * Solution: split the text into FROZEN segments (complete, append-only blocks)
 * plus one ACTIVE tail. Frozen segment text never changes again, so each is
 * rendered by its own memoized <ReactMarkdown> exactly ONCE; only the small
 * active tail re-parses. At message end the parent does ONE authoritative
 * full-document parse, so any segmentation imperfection is transient.
 *
 * Splitting rules (CommonMark-aware enough for live preview):
 *  - Split points are blank lines OUTSIDE fenced code blocks.
 *  - An unclosed ```/~~~ fence keeps everything after its opener in the tail
 *    (half-rendered code as markdown would flash horribly on close).
 *  - A blank line followed by a list marker does NOT split: CommonMark treats
 *    blank-line-separated items as one (loose) list — splitting would restart
 *    ordered numbering at 1.
 *  - Setext headings / forward link-reference definitions across splits are
 *    accepted imperfections; the final full parse corrects them.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (unit-tested from tsconfig.tests.json).
